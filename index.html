          <p>
            17-year-old developer fully of inspiration to go on facing new coding challenges
            with approximately a year of experience in programming. I've significantly upgraded
            my knowledge in programming since I started my coding journey year ago. While I was studying
            at 10th grade at school, I was going through RS courses and finally passed them. That
            breakthrough has proved that I am capable of gaining difficult pieces of knowledge rapidly
            no matter the conditions. And the funny thing is that I am still gaining them :)

        <p>
        I finished RS courses last spring and after that I started learning Vue framework.
        Then I was using gained pieces of knowledge while working for Effor company.
        Moreover, I completed dozens of tasks from different courses successfully.
        In addition, I were working on my own projects. For instance, now I am learning
        React + Node.js and creating project's template in order to use it in my sooner
        freelance projects.

        <p>
        Since I haven't graduated from the school yet I haven't got
        higher education. Now I am studying at Lyceum BNTY in 11th grade
        at phys-math class. I've already visited lots of RS events( RS conf 2018 and etc.) and
        as I've mentioned before I had passed RS courses.

      <div class="english-info-container">
        <h1 class="heading">English (B2)</h1>
        <p>
        I've been learning english for 11 years at New J courses.
        Last year I passed final exams at that courses and got
        B2 level certificate. Now I am still visiting lessons of that courses since
        our teacher is native-speaker and I want to gain as much knowledge from
        speaking with her as I can. Moreover, I'm watching Ted Talks in English everyday since
        I believe hearing foreign speach will help me to improve my language skills.
        In addition, I have my own blog on medium, where I am writing articles
        in English on both technical and usual topics.
