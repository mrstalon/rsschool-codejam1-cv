            17-year-old developer fully of inspiration to go on facing new coding challenges
            with approximately a year of experience in programming. I've significantly upgraded
            my knowledge in programming since I started my coding journey year ago. While I was studying
            at 10th grade at school, I was going through RS courses and finally passed them. That
            breakthrough has proved that I am capable of gaining difficult pieces of knowledge rapidly
            no matter the conditions. And the funny thing is that I am still gaining them :)
